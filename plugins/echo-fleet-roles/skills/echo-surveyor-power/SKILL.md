# ECHO Surveyor Power

Self-contained compiled power skill for the `surveyor` role. Loading this skill alone delivers the full method (base + role composition). Do not rely on `Load $…` composition.

## Base

Shared fleet base (proofline verification, risk/action review, grounding) is inlined below from `echo-fleet-base`.

### echo-proofline-verification

# Echo Proofline Verification

Verify the latest route matrix:

```powershell
& "C:\ECHO_OMEGA_PRIME\SYSTEMS\echo_ops_control_suite\scripts\Test-EchoOpsEvidence.ps1"
```

## Required proof

A route recovery passes only when:

- Local passes equal local expected.
- Public passes equal public expected.
- Every local and public response identity matches.
- Distinct Cloudflare Ray IDs cover the public requests.
- `OverallPass` is true.

The verifier writes a SHA-256-bound proof JSON. A single HTTP 200 is not proof. A tunnel connection is not proof. A service state is not proof. The claim and its supporting artifact must agree.

For broader delivery claims, use `echo-delivery-evidence`.

### echo-risk-action-review

# Echo Risk Action Review

Every mutation plan must state:

```text
hypothesis
evidence
falsification_condition
exact_action
affected_resources
rollback
expected_local_result
expected_public_result
stop_condition
action_id
```

Mutating plans additionally require:

```text
confirmation_token
expected_current_state
idempotency_key
```

Run:

```powershell
& "C:\ECHO_OMEGA_PRIME\SYSTEMS\echo_ops_control_suite\scripts\Test-EchoOpsRiskGate.ps1" `
  -PlanPath "C:\path\mutation-plan.json"
```

The gate rejects arbitrary `command`, `shell`, `cmd`, or `ScriptBlock` fields. A passing review authorizes only the declared action ID; it does not authorize adjacent work.

## Grounding

- Prefer live system state (SDK invoke, service health, queue, git) over memory or conjecture.
- Separate facts, inferences, and open questions explicitly.
- Never treat a role label as an authorization grant; stay inside the scoped broker token.
- Fail closed on destructive or high-impact actions unless the approval gate clears them.
- Persist material decisions with attribution; leave a verification trail for the next operator.


## Method

Role-specific composed skills (capped at 5, base refs stripped):
- `echo-runbook-generation`
- `superpowers:systematic-debugging`

### Method component: echo-runbook-generation

# Echo Runbook Generation

Generate a runbook from the newest incident summary and route matrix:

```powershell
& "C:\ECHO_OMEGA_PRIME\SYSTEMS\echo_ops_control_suite\scripts\New-EchoOpsRunbook.ps1"
```

The runbook includes:

- Authoritative artifact paths
- Local/public pass counts
- Failed route rows with Ray IDs
- Recovery doctrine
- Rollback retention requirements
- Incident summary excerpt

## Rules

- Do not rewrite failed evidence as a successful narrative.
- Preserve exact service, path, HTTP, and identity details.
- Mark missing artifacts explicitly.
- Keep backups until the route matrix passes after one service restart.
- Store generated runbooks under the configured Echo Ops audit directory.

### Method component: superpowers:systematic-debugging

# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - They often contain the exact solution
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Does it happen every time?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**

   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**
   ```
   For EACH component boundary:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation
     - Check state at each layer

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

   **Example (multi-layer system):**
   ```bash
   # Layer 1: Workflow
   echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
   echo "IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}"

   # Layer 2: Build script
   echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
   env | grep IDENTITY || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

   # Layer 3: Signing script
   echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
   security list-keychains
   security find-identity -v

   # Layer 4: Actual signing
   codesign --sign "{IDENTITY}" --verbose=4 "{APP}"
   ```

   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)

5. **Trace Data Flow**

   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.

   **Quick version:**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line
   - Understand the pattern fully before applying

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small
   - Don't assume "that can't matter"

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?
   - What assumptions does it make?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Write it down
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

4. **When You Don't Know**
   - Say "I don't understand X"
   - Don't pretend to know
   - Ask for help
   - Research more

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - One-off test script if no framework
   - MUST have before fixing
   - Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements
   - No bundled refactoring

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?
   - Issue actually resolved?
   - Use the `superpowers:verification-before-completion` skill before claiming success

4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**
   - STOP
   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?
   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**
   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**

   **Pattern indicating architectural problem:**
   - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place
   - Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

   **STOP and question fundamentals:**
   - Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
   - Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
   - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

   **Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**

   This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5)

## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultra-think this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptom

…(truncated for compiled role skill)…


## Role operating loop

Produce an authoritative map that another role can act on without rediscovering the environment.

## Survey loop

1. Define the survey boundary, decision it supports, freshness target, and prohibited data.
2. Resolve live nodes, repositories, services, processes, ports, storage, databases, queues, dependencies, and owners through authoritative sources.
3. Cross-check declared inventory against runtime state, git, service managers, network bindings, and data stores.
4. Model relationships and critical paths. Label confirmed facts, inferred edges, unreachable targets, stale declarations, and unknown ownership.
5. Rank drift and gaps by blast radius, recoverability, security, cost, and impact on active missions.
6. Validate representative paths end to end and produce remediation-ready findings with exact evidence and commands.
7. Publish a dated manifest or map, register it, persist material topology decisions, and define the refresh path.

## Capability contract

Use `echo.monitor.*`, `echo.node.*`, `echo.fs.*`, read-only `echo.psql.*`, `echo.logs.*`, `echo.logaggregator.*`, `echo.git.*`, and bounded `echo.shell.*` through the scoped broker. Resolve moving addresses and identifiers live.

## Proof gate

Inventory counts are not a system map. Completion requires source provenance, freshness timestamps, relationship validation, drift classification, and actionable ownership for critical gaps.

## Capability contract

- Scopes: `echo.caps.*`, `echo.fs.*`, `echo.git.*`, `echo.logaggregator.*`, `echo.logs.*`, `echo.monitor.*`, `echo.node.*`, `echo.psql.*`, `echo.sdk.*`, `echo.shell.*`
- Capability families: `echo.fs.*`, `echo.monitor.*`, `echo.node.*`
- Invoke through `sol_cli.py sdk invoke` with the role-scoped SOL_BROKER_TOKEN; never paste sovereign credentials.

## Adoption gate

Before Edit/Write/Bash/echo.*-invoke, the runtime requires this skill loaded for role `surveyor`. If denied, run: `Skill(echo-fleet-roles:echo-surveyor-power)` (or equivalent Skill tool load).
