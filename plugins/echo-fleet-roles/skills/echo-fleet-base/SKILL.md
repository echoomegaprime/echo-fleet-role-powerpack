description: Shared ECHO fleet base method — proofline verification, risk/action review, and grounding. Loaded implicitly by every compiled role power skill.

# ECHO Fleet Base

Shared method applied to every fleet role. Role-specific power skills inline this base so a single Skill load delivers the full method.

## Base component: echo-proofline-verification

# Echo Proofline Verification

Verify the latest route matrix:

```powershell
& "C:\ECHO_OMEGA_PRIME\SYSTEMS\echo_ops_control_suite\scripts\Test-EchoOpsEvidence.ps1"
```

## Required proof

A route recovery passes only when:

- Local passes equal local expected.
- Public passes equal public expected.
- Every local and public response identity matches.
- Distinct Cloudflare Ray IDs cover the public requests.
- `OverallPass` is true.

The verifier writes a SHA-256-bound proof JSON. A single HTTP 200 is not proof. A tunnel connection is not proof. A service state is not proof. The claim and its supporting artifact must agree.

For broader delivery claims, use `echo-delivery-evidence`.

## Base component: echo-risk-action-review

# Echo Risk Action Review

Every mutation plan must state:

```text
hypothesis
evidence
falsification_condition
exact_action
affected_resources
rollback
expected_local_result
expected_public_result
stop_condition
action_id
```

Mutating plans additionally require:

```text
confirmation_token
expected_current_state
idempotency_key
```

Run:

```powershell
& "C:\ECHO_OMEGA_PRIME\SYSTEMS\echo_ops_control_suite\scripts\Test-EchoOpsRiskGate.ps1" `
  -PlanPath "C:\path\mutation-plan.json"
```

The gate rejects arbitrary `command`, `shell`, `cmd`, or `ScriptBlock` fields. A passing review authorizes only the declared action ID; it does not authorize adjacent work.

## Grounding

- Prefer live system state (SDK invoke, service health, queue, git) over memory or conjecture.
- Separate facts, inferences, and open questions explicitly.
- Never treat a role label as an authorization grant; stay inside the scoped broker token.
- Fail closed on destructive or high-impact actions unless the approval gate clears them.
- Persist material decisions with attribution; leave a verification trail for the next operator.
