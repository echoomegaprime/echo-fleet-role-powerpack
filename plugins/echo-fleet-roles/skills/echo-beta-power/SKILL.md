# ECHO Beta Power

Self-contained compiled power skill for the `beta` role. Loading this skill alone delivers the full method (base + role composition). Do not rely on `Load $…` composition.

## Base

Shared fleet base (proofline verification, risk/action review, grounding) is inlined below from `echo-fleet-base`.

### echo-proofline-verification

# Echo Proofline Verification

Verify the latest route matrix:

```powershell
& "C:\ECHO_OMEGA_PRIME\SYSTEMS\echo_ops_control_suite\scripts\Test-EchoOpsEvidence.ps1"
```

## Required proof

A route recovery passes only when:

- Local passes equal local expected.
- Public passes equal public expected.
- Every local and public response identity matches.
- Distinct Cloudflare Ray IDs cover the public requests.
- `OverallPass` is true.

The verifier writes a SHA-256-bound proof JSON. A single HTTP 200 is not proof. A tunnel connection is not proof. A service state is not proof. The claim and its supporting artifact must agree.

For broader delivery claims, use `echo-delivery-evidence`.

### echo-risk-action-review

# Echo Risk Action Review

Every mutation plan must state:

```text
hypothesis
evidence
falsification_condition
exact_action
affected_resources
rollback
expected_local_result
expected_public_result
stop_condition
action_id
```

Mutating plans additionally require:

```text
confirmation_token
expected_current_state
idempotency_key
```

Run:

```powershell
& "C:\ECHO_OMEGA_PRIME\SYSTEMS\echo_ops_control_suite\scripts\Test-EchoOpsRiskGate.ps1" `
  -PlanPath "C:\path\mutation-plan.json"
```

The gate rejects arbitrary `command`, `shell`, `cmd`, or `ScriptBlock` fields. A passing review authorizes only the declared action ID; it does not authorize adjacent work.

## Grounding

- Prefer live system state (SDK invoke, service health, queue, git) over memory or conjecture.
- Separate facts, inferences, and open questions explicitly.
- Never treat a role label as an authorization grant; stay inside the scoped broker token.
- Fail closed on destructive or high-impact actions unless the approval gate clears them.
- Persist material decisions with attribution; leave a verification trail for the next operator.


## Method

Role-specific composed skills (capped at 5, base refs stripped):
- `browser-automation`
- `echo-delivery-evidence`
- `data-analytics:validate-data`

### Method component: browser-automation

# browser-automation

_Auto-mirrored from Grok charter via SYSTEMS/skill_mirror/generate.py._

## When to use

Complete browser automation platform using Playwright and Puppeteer for web scraping, form filling, screenshot capture, PDF generation, session management, and headless browser control

## How it runs

This skill is a **dispatch stub**. Runtime is provided by
`echo-charter-engine.execute(charter_slug="browser-automation")`, which classifies the
described behavior into primitive operations and dispatches through the 8
`echo-*-operator` primitives.

```python
from importlib.util import spec_from_file_location, module_from_spec
from pathlib import Path
engine_path = Path.home() / '.claude' / 'skills' / 'echo-charter-engine' / 'engine.py'
spec = spec_from_file_location('_engine', engine_path)
mod = module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(mod)
result = mod.CharterEngine().execute('browser-automation')
```

## Original charter

To change runtime behavior, EITHER add a hand-curated mapping in
`echo-charter-engine/dispatch_map.json` keyed by `'browser-automation'`, OR add new
keyword routes in `echo-charter-engine/engine.py` `_KEYWORD_TO_OP`.

## Universal Codex operating rules

- Read this `SKILL.md` before using the skill.
- Use included `scripts/`, `references/`, `templates/`, and `assets/` when present instead of recreating them.
- Do not expose secret values, tokens, credentials, taxpayer data, private keys, or real client records.
- Prefer read-only inspection first. Destructive operations require an explicit user command naming the target.
- For high-risk skills, produce a plan and confirm scope before executing system-changing commands.

*Automated. Invisible. Unstoppable. - ECHO PRIME*

### Method component: echo-delivery-evidence

# Echo Delivery Evidence

Create a delivery manifest containing:

- `claim`
- `mission.id`
- `mission.build`
- `mission.decision_memory`
- `mission.status` equal to `complete`
- Artifact paths and SHA-256 values
- Test names, `passed` status, and evidence paths

Validate it:

```powershell
& "C:\ECHO_OMEGA_PRIME\SYSTEMS\echo_ops_control_suite\scripts\Test-EchoDeliveryEvidence.ps1" `
  -ManifestPath "C:\path\delivery-manifest.json"
```

A claim fails when an artifact is missing, a hash differs, evidence is absent, a test did not pass, or mission identity is incomplete. Never accept prose alone as delivery evidence.

### Method component: data-analytics:validate-data

## Related Skills

Use `analyze-data-quality` when validation depends on whether the underlying data is trustworthy, comparable, fresh, or at the right grain.

Use `product-business-analysis` when the task asks for a recommendation or decision after the validation pass.

# Validate Data Analysis

Validate an analysis before it is shared with stakeholders. Focus on whether the question, data, methodology, calculations, visuals, claims, caveats, and recommendations are trustworthy enough for the stated audience and decision.
This skill is for analysis QA, not raw dataset profiling alone. When validation depends on dataset reliability checks such as freshness, grain, missingness,
duplicates, join coverage, or source mismatches, use `analyze-data-quality` as a companion.

## Workflow

1. Inventory the artifact and claims.

   Identify the report, notebook, spreadsheet, SQL, dashboard, chart, pasted analysis, or recommendation being validated. Inspect source artifacts when a path, link, query, notebook, spreadsheet, or dashboard is referenced. Extract the main question, audience, decision, key claims, headline numbers, data sources, time windows, populations, filters, comparison baselines, and stated caveats. Verify that every metric or KPI requested by the user appears in the analysis or is explicitly marked unavailable, not applicable, or out of scope.

2. Validate the question, methodology, and assumptions.

   Confirm that the analysis answers the stated business or product question,
   not a nearby easier question. Check whether the population, eligibility rules, exclusions, sampling, metric definitions, formulas, units,
   denominators, timezones, cohorts, comparison periods, and baselines match the stakeholder decision. Flag hidden exclusions, inconsistent definitions,
   partial-period comparisons, and causal wording that lacks experimental or otherwise credible causal evidence.

3. Validate data selection and quality risks.

   Confirm that the chosen tables, files, dashboards, or extracts are appropriate and current enough for the decision. Check freshness or "as of"
   date, expected partitions, segment coverage, row/category completeness, null handling, deduplication, filter logic, join coverage, and source mismatches when those risks could change the conclusion. Use `~~structured_data` for source metadata, schema checks, sample rows, query history, or SQL spot checks through the relevant source connector when available. Use `~~operations_logs` for table freshness, lineage, or pipeline context.

4. Verify calculations and aggregations.

   Recompute the highest-impact numbers independently when possible. Check grain, subtotals, denominators, non-zero denominators, rate bases,
   period-over-period bases, weighted averages, units, currency, timezone handling, and whether mutually exclusive categories add to totals. For SQL,
   inspect join types, group-by grain, filters, distinct counts, and row counts before and after joins. Use `jupyter-notebooks` or `~~spreadsheet_workspace`
   when the artifact itself is a notebook or spreadsheet, or when reproducible spot checks need code or formulas.

5. Test reasonableness and common analytical traps.

   Compare magnitudes against known dashboards, historical reports, prior analyses, finance sources, or expected product scale when possible. Investigate trend jumps, drops, flatlines, exact round numbers, 0% or 100% rates, segment shares that should sum to about 100%, and results that perfectly confirm the hypothesis without friction. Check edge cases such as empty segments, new entities, and boundary dates.

6. Review visuals and presentation integrity.

   Confirm that charts use appropriate chart types, scales, axes, intervals,
   titles, labels, units, ordering, annotations, color, and precision. Use
   `visualize-data` for non-trivial chart review. For rendered reports,
   dashboards, slides, docs, PDFs, HTML, or other final artifacts, inspect the rendered output for broken charts, missing tables, clipped text, bad formatting, stale placeholders, and obvious layout issues. Check whether a quick reader could walk away with a misleading interpretation, especially from truncated axes, dual axes, 3D effects, inconsistent intervals, missing date ranges, or chart titles that overstate the data.

7. Evaluate narrative, conclusions, and recommendations.

   Confirm each conclusion is supported by visible evidence or saved artifacts.
   Separate verified findings from interpretation, caveats, and open questions.
   Identify alternative explanations, uncertainty, missing context,
   recommendations that go beyond the evidence, and any causal language that is not supported by the design.

8. Produce a confidence assessment and required fixes.

   Prioritize issues that materially affect the stakeholder decision. Separate blockers from caveats: do not block sharing for minor polish issues, but do block when a number, denominator, join, time window, population, comparison,
   or conclusion is materially unreliable. Record incomplete handoff blockers separately from caveats, including missing access, unavailable source artifacts, unrun checks, broken render steps, unresolved data-quality risks,
   or absent owner confirmation. If SQL, Python, a notebook, or a spreadsheet was used for validation, include the artifact path, query permalink, notebook path, spreadsheet tab, or dashboard link so the check is reproducible.

## Standards

### Validation Stance

- Validate the claims the analysis actually makes, not just whether the artifact looks polished.
- Prefer concrete evidence: recompute important numbers, inspect source data,
  check code paths, trace records, or reconcile against trusted sources when tools and access allow it.
- Label anything that cannot be verified, and state what would be needed to verify it.
- Treat surprising results, stakeholder-facing recommendations, causal claims,
  high-impact decisions, and externally shared analyses as higher-risk validation targets.
- Select checks that match the artifact and decision. Do not run every possible check mechanically.

### Methodology Checks

- Question framing: the analysis answers the stated business or product question.
- Data selection: sources are appropriate and current enough for the decision.
- Population: inclusions, exclusions, eligibility rules, and sampling are explicit.
- Metric definitions: formulas, units, denominators, and timezones are clear and aligned with stakeholder definitions.
- Baselines: comparison periods, cohorts, and contexts are comparable.
- Causality: causal wording is backed by experimental or otherwise credible causal evidence.

### Data Quality Checks

- Freshness: the analysis states or can recover the data "as of" date.
- Completeness: no unexpected missing partitions, segments, rows, or categories.
- Null handling: key columns have expected null rates or explicit treatment.
- Deduplication: primary entities are not double counted.
- Filter verification: filters and WHERE clauses do not silently exclude the population of interest.
- Join coverage: dimensions, experiments, and reference tables do not drop or multiply important rows.

### Calculation Checks

- Grain: the aggregation level matches the intended analysis grain.
- Denominators: rates and percentages use the correct population and non-zero denominators.
- Period alignment: comparisons use equal or explicitly caveated windows.
- Weighted metrics: averages are weighted correctly when group sizes differ.
- Subtotals: parts add to totals where categories are mutually exclusive.
- Units: currency, token, user, request, account, day/week/month, and timezone units are consistent.

### Reasonableness Checks

- Magnitudes are plausible relative to known dashboards, historical reports, or expected product scale.
- Percentages fall in expected ranges and segment shares sum to about 100% wh

## Role operating loop

Test what a real user experiences, across happy paths, edge cases, degraded dependencies, accessibility, performance, and recovery.

## Beta loop

1. Resolve the live or staging target, release identity, persona, supported environments, and acceptance criteria.
2. Verify the URL or executable is reachable before creating a beta objective or claiming testability.
3. Design journeys that cover onboarding, core value, invalid input, empty state, permissions, persistence, refresh, failure, and recovery.
4. Execute in a clean isolated session while capturing timestamps, screenshots, network or console evidence, build identity, and exact reproduction steps.
5. Triage by user impact and reproducibility. Distinguish product defects, environment faults, test-data problems, and unclear requirements.
6. Re-test fixes from the original reproduction, then run adjacent regression journeys.
7. Update the beta objective truthfully, register results, persist recurring failure patterns, and continue until the release gate is resolved.

## Capability contract

Use `claude.shadowglass.*`, `echo.beta.*`, `echo.website.*`, and `echo.sentinel.*` through the scoped broker. Reserve a dedicated browser tab and never expose protected fields or session secrets.

## Proof gate

Pass requires a real journey on the declared build and target, not an HTTP 200 alone. Failures require deterministic reproduction evidence; fixes require a clean re-test and adjacent regression coverage.

## Capability contract

- Scopes: `claude.shadowglass.*`, `echo.beta.*`, `echo.caps.*`, `echo.sdk.*`, `echo.sentinel.*`, `echo.website.*`
- Capability families: `claude.shadowglass.*`, `echo.beta.*`, `echo.website.*`
- Invoke through `sol_cli.py sdk invoke` with the role-scoped SOL_BROKER_TOKEN; never paste sovereign credentials.

## Adoption gate

Before Edit/Write/Bash/echo.*-invoke, the runtime requires this skill loaded for role `beta`. If denied, run: `Skill(echo-fleet-roles:echo-beta-power)` (or equivalent Skill tool load).
